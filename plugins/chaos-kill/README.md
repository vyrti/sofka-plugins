# Chaos kill

Deletes pods belonging to the selected workload and waits for it to become
ready again, reporting how long that took — or that it never did.

Select a Deployment, StatefulSet, or DaemonSet and enter `:chaos-kill`.

## This deletes running pods

Sofka can already delete a pod. What this adds is the measurement afterwards: a
workload that does not come back, or takes minutes to, is the finding.

Every safeguard sofka has is turned on:

- **`dry_run` defaults to `true`.** The first run tells you which pods it would
  delete and stops. Only `dry_run=false` — the exact string — deletes anything.
- **`mutating = true`**, so it is refused outright in read-only mode.
- **`dangerous = true`**, so sofka confirms before every run and marks the
  dialog.
- **Scoped to workloads that replace their own pods.** A bare pod has nothing
  to recover it, so killing one is a delete, not a test.
- **Never cluster-wide.** A namespace is required; the adapter refuses without
  one.
- A `plugin:chaos-kill` [guardrail](https://github.com/nklmilojevic/sofka/blob/main/docs/safety.md)
  can deny it per namespace. Put one on production.

## What it picks

The oldest running pods, in creation order, skipping any that are already
terminating or not yet running. Deleting a pod that is on its way out proves
nothing, and a total order means a dry run tells the truth about the run that
follows it.

It reads `spec.selector.matchLabels` to find them. A selector using
`matchExpressions` is refused rather than approximated — guessing would delete
the wrong pods.

## Inputs

| Input     | Default | Purpose                                           |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `dry_run` | `true`  | Report what would be deleted, delete nothing.     |
| `count`   | `1`     | How many pods to delete, up to 10.                |
| `wait`    | `120s`  | How long to wait for recovery, up to 300 seconds. |

`:chaos-kill dry_run=false count=2 wait=60s`

## Dependencies

`kubectl` on `PATH`. It runs with your credentials and against the context
sofka is showing.

## Limitations

- Readiness comes from the workload's own status. A Deployment reporting ready
  replicas is not proof that traffic is being served correctly.
- It deletes pods; it does not partition networks, exhaust CPU, or inject
  latency. For those, use a purpose-built chaos platform.
- Recovery time includes image pulls, so a cold node makes a healthy workload
  look slow.
